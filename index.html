			<p style="font-family: omnes-pro, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 17px;">Aikido is a non-aggressive, non-competitive Japanese martial art that promotes self-confidence, balance, 
                coordination, and fitness in a friendly, enjoyable environment. It is suitable for people of all ages, sizes, 
                and fitness levels, and can be practiced as both a form of exercise and self-defense. Aikido does not require 
                physical strength or aggression, making it ideal for children too, and it has been practiced in New Zealand 
                for the past 55 years under Shihan Nobuo Takase, 8th Degree Black Belt, who teaches at Ramarama together with 
                other world-class instructors.

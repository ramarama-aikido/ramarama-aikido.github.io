                <b>Aikido </b>is a non-aggressive, non-competitive Japanese martial art that promotes self-confidence, balance, 
                coordination, and fitness in a friendly, enjoyable environment. It is suitable for people of all ages, sizes, 
                and fitness levels, and can be practiced as both a form of exercise and self-defense. <b>Aikido</b> does not require 
                physical strength or aggression, making it ideal for children too, and it has been practiced in New Zealand 
                for the past 55 years under <b><i>Shihan Nobuo Takase, 8th Degree Black Belt</i></b>, 
                who teaches at Ramarama together with other world-class instructors.

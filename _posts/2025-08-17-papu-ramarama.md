We're excited to announce that Papu Sensei will be joining us for this Monday's training!.
Even better, the session will be extended to 2 full hours, running from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM.

This special class will be led by both Papu Sensei and Sarah Sensei, giving us a rare opportunity
to learn from their different techniques and approaches in one session.

Please remember to bring enough water and come prepared for an engaging and energetic practice.
It's going to be a fantastic evening of training - don't miss it!

We are looking forward to seeing you on the mat and sharing this special session together.

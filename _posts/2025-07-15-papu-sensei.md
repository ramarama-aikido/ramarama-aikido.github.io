We just got word from Marie that Papu Sensei has returned from China and will be staying in Cambridge for a while.

There’s a good chance we’ll see him at the training on Sunday, 27th July at the Cambridge Dojo. 
Let’s all look forward to welcoming him back and enjoying a great session together.

See you on the mat!

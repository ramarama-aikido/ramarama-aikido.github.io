Great news—our visit to the Cambridge Dojo is now confirmed!
It will take place on Sunday, 27th July, from 11:00am to 1:00pm.

We’re all looking forward to this special session, which will be led by Patrick and Marie. 
It’s a fantastic opportunity to come together, share our Aikido techniques, and enjoy a fun and enriching training experience.

After the training, we’ll be heading to Joe’s Garage for lunch—a great chance to relax, connect, and continue the conversations off the mat.

Mark your calendars - we hope to see you all there !

The Cambridge Camkada Judo Club is located at: Thornton Road, Cambridge.
